#  **UK Road Accident Dashboard (Power BI)**  
A comprehensive data analytics project exploring accident patterns across the UK using **STATS19 Road Safety Data (2021)**.  
This dashboard uncovers key insights into accident severity, contributing weather/road conditions, high-risk road types, and monthly casualty trends.

---

##  **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analytics skills, including:  
- Data cleaning & transformation in **Power Query**  
- Creating calculated columns & DAX measures  
- Designing an interactive, insight-driven dashboard  
- Extracting trends related to road safety and accident severity  
- Communicating insights visually for stakeholders

The dashboard helps decision-makers understand where and why accidents happen — supporting safety interventions and better planning.

</p>

### **Insight:**  
This visual highlights how accident frequency changes under different combinations of **weather conditions** and **road surface types**.

Key observations:  
- Most accidents occur under **dry** or **wet/damp** conditions due to higher traffic volumes.  
- Hazardous conditions such as **snow**, **ice**, or **flooding** contribute fewer accidents because fewer vehicles are on the road.  
- Wet conditions with fine or light winds show significantly higher accident counts.

## **2️⃣ Accidents by Road Type and Severity**

</p>

### **Insight:**  
- **Single carriageways** show the highest number of accidents across all severity levels.  
- **Dual carriageways** have fewer accidents but still contribute thousands of casualties.  
- Roundabouts, slip roads, and one-way streets show comparatively lower accident counts.

**Conclusion:**  
Road type is a strong predictor of accident likelihood, with single carriageways representing the highest-risk category.

### 🔎 **Dashboard Highlights**

#### ✔ **Casualties by Road Surface & Severity**  
- Wet or damp surfaces account for the largest number of casualties.  
- Slight casualties dominate across all surface categories.

#### ✔ **Casualties by Road Type**  
- Single carriageways account for the majority of casualties.  
- Dual carriageways and roundabouts show moderate contributions.

#### ✔ **Casualties by Location (Urban vs Rural)**  
- **Urban areas:** ~64%  
- **Rural areas:** ~35%  
Urban areas experienced higher traffic density, resulting in more accidents.

#### ✔ **Monthly Casualty Trend**  
- Casualties peak between **May and October**.  
- Winter months (January–February & December) show reduced casualty levels.

#### ✔ **Key KPIs**  
- **101K** Total Accidents  
- **128K** Total Casualties  
- **1474** Fatal  
- **21K** Serious  
- **78K** Slight  

These KPIs give a clear high-level summary of the UK’s 2021 road safety landscape.
